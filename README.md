# House Rocket Company Challenge - Exploratory Data Analyses Project

House Rocket is a digital platform that has as its business model, the purchase and sale of property using technology.

The company, through its CEO, would like to maximize its revenue by finding good business opportunities in King County, Washington, USA. To do this, its main strategy is to buy properties in good condition and great locations, with below market prices, and then resell them at more attractive prices for profit. The greater the difference between buying and selling, the greater the company's profit and thus its revenue.

However, the houses have characteristics that make them more or less attractive to buyers and sellers. For example, the location and the internal area of the property.

Therefore, the CEO has requested a  Exploratory Data Analysis** work to answer three key questions for future decision making. These are them:

- **Which houses should the CEO of House Rocket buy and at what price ?**


- **Once the house is in the company's possession, what is the best time to sell it and what would be the sale price ?**


- **Does House Rocket have to reform its houses to increase the selling price ? What would be the suggestions for change ?**
